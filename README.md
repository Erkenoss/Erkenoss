## About Me
I have recently completed my first year at Holberton France Toulouse and I am currently seeking an internship opportunity in the field of **AR/VR**.

My professional background is diverse, with experience in various sectors. My interests are equally varied, ranging from chess and video games to RPGs, the metal universe, and human relationships.

I have acquired a solid foundation in programming during my time at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/), where I gained proficiency in languages such as C, Python, as well as some aspects of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can explore my projects in these languages on my GitHub repository.

Currently, I am developing my portfolio using Unity with the intention of transitioning it into a web application. Additionally, I am collaborating with a friend on a Unity project similar to TaleSpire, featuring animated characters and customizable maps (stored in a private repository). Concurrently, I am working on my own RPG game to create a unique universe.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my background and the technologies I am proficient in.
